    <div class="main-content-bio"> Hello my name is jonathan Diaz. I am 19 years old and i am from newyork. i moved
        down to orlando, florida when i was 7 years old and have loved it ever since. I got into coding because of one of 
        my friends who really enjoyed it and said i should get into it. I then went out of my way and started practicing 
        on khan academy. I found it very interesting so i did some research and got a word from my friend 
        who attended the UCF CodingBootcamp and said that it was very informative and that i should join.
